    Represents assignment of a Subject under a specific ProfessorWorkload (within a semester).

    Fields overview:
    - id: numeric primary key.
    - workload_id: FK to ProfessorWorkload (budget/context of hours).
    - subject_id: FK to Subject being taught.
    - hours_per_subject: allocated hours for the subject within the workload.
    - unique constraint: one SubjectAssignment per (workload, subject).
    - relationships: subject, workload, lessons.
    - properties: professor, direction (convenience accessors).
